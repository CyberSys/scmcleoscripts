// 0xA49960: script variables are saved here
// &0: ADMA first variable, so pointing to 0xA49960

// 0xB7CE50: player money
// 0xB7CE50 - 0xA49960 = 0x1334F0

0006: 2@ = 0x1334F0
// divide by 4, because every element in array is a dword
0016: 2@ /= 4
0004: &0(2@,1i) = 50000
//     ^ always &0

// player now has $50000
