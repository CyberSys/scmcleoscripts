Good day all,

This is a mod that I made which changes the HUD panel on PL.

Main features:
* Fixes fuel/health bars showing while on foot
* Fixes heading bar having values like -1 -0 (0) 1 2 or 358 359 (360) 361 362
* Changes 'Damage' to 'Health'
* Per-frame instant updates for: heading bar, mission distance left, altitude, airspeed/car speed, vehicle health (both percentage and bar). [b]This means (internet) lag won't affect the update rate of the panel for these values![/b]
* Blinking fuel bar when fuel is 20% or less
* Blinking health bar when health is 35% or less

Aside from these general patches, there are 3 themes available:

[size=12pt]Standard theme[/size]
[/font][/color][hr][color=black][font=arial]
The normal bar as you probably know it, but with the patches.

[color=blue][u][url=https://youtu.be/c9XvolkgaUE]demo video[/url][/u][/color] - just watch how instantly the indicators update, this is like pr0n

[size=14pt]Requirements[/size]
You need CLEO4: [color=blue][u][url=http://cleo.li]http://cleo.li[/url][/u][/color].
I won't help you with installing CLEO, use the internet and your common sense (if applicable).
I only tested this on my exe, which is the EU1.0 version according to SAMP. I might look for compatibility with other exe's later.

[size=14pt]Download[/size]
Download this cs file: [color=blue][u][url=https://github.com/yugecin/scmcleoscripts/blob/master/cleoplugins/plpanel/plpanel.cs?raw=true]plpanel.cs[/url][/u][/color]
Themes: [color=blue][u][url=https://github.com/yugecin/scmcleoscripts/blob/master/cleoplugins/plpanel/Release/plpanel-standard.cleo?raw=true]plpanel-standard.cleo[/url][/u][/color] - [color=blue][u][url=https://github.com/yugecin/scmcleoscripts/blob/master/cleoplugins/plpanel/Release/plpanel-classic.cleo?raw=true]plpanel-classic.cleo[/url][/u][/color] - [color=blue][u][url=https://github.com/yugecin/scmcleoscripts/blob/master/cleoplugins/plpanel/Release/plpanel-robin.cleo?raw=true]plpanel-robin.cleo[/url][/u][/color]

[size=14pt]Installation[/size]
Put the plpanel.cs file and [b]ONE[/b] of the .cleo files (choose your theme) in your CLEO directory.

[b]uninstall:[/b] remove the .cs and the .cleo
[b]switching themes:[/b] remove the .cleo file and place a different one in the CLEO directory

The CLEO directory is where your GTASA installation is placed, usually at [font=courier]C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas\[/font].
If you can't find the [font=courier]CLEO [/font]folder, you are either looking in the wrong place, or you didn't install CLEO (correctly) yet: in that case, go back to Requirements.

[size=14pt]Usage[/size]
No usage, it is always active.
It won't have any effect on different servers or in singleplayer, so you don't need to uninstall it to play on non-pl servers.

[size=14pt]Disclaimer[/size]
Use this at your own risk. You won't get banned for using this (unless hud things get banned - but even then admins cannot detect this), but no guarantee that this won't break your computer, dog or marriage.

[size=14pt]OMG MY GAEM CRASH WHEN START PLZ HELP!!!!1!11[/size]
I only tested this on my exe, which is the EU1.0 version according to SAMP. Try to find a compatible [s]crack[/s] exe. I'm not going to help you with this, sorry. Just ask google (gta sa eu 1.0).

[size=8pt]Psst: it's on github:

Have a good flight!


Cheers[/color]
