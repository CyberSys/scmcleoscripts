Recreating the Vice City styled weapon pickups.

[Demo video](https://youtu.be/0gjT1hsOTI8)

There are 3 versions because of limits. There are only 64 scriptable coronas available and the normal version uses 3 coronas per pickup. This means not all weapon pickups get the effects if there are too many visible.

The -condensed version uses 2 coronas per pickup, omitting one of the rings. The -ultracondensed version uses only 1 corona, and this one has no special effects (static).

See the demo video for the difference.
