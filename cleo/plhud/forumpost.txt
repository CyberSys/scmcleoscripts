[color=black][font=arial][size=12pt]Current version: v17 with 163 runways[/size]
[s]For new versions: just redownload plhud.cs and replace it, unless otherwise noted. Check your current version by pressing F10: there should show a message saying the current version & how many runways are loaded.[/s]
You only need the .cs since v14.

[b][size=14pt]CLEO Runway helper[/size][/b]
This CLEO mod shows you where PL runways are.

Additionally, it will move the airstrip icons on your radar so you can see where it is on you minimap. (If you only want this, you can just set the viewdistance to 0.)

[color=blue][u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtfCMnLkYAk]Demo YouTube vid[/url][/u][/color]

[b][size=14pt]Requirements[/size][/b]
You need CLEO3 or higher: [color=blue][u][url=http://cleo.li]http://cleo.li[/url][/u][/color].
I won't help you with installing CLEO, use the internet and your common sense (if applicable).
I only tested this on my exe, which is the EU1.0 version according to SAMP. I might look for compatibility with other exe's later.

[size=14pt]Download[/size]
[color=blue][u][url=https://github.com/yugecin/scmcleoscripts/blob/master/cleo/plhud/new/plhud.cs?raw=true]plhud.cs[/url][/u][/color]

[size=14pt]Installation[/size]
Put [font=courier]plhud.cs[/font] in your CLEO directory.

The CLEO directory is where your GTASA installation is placed, usually at [font=courier]C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas\[/font].
If you can't find the [font=courier]CLEO [/font]folder, you are either looking in the wrong place, or you didn't install CLEO (correctly) yet: in that case, go back to Requirements.

[size=14pt]Usage[/size]
* [font=courier]F10[/font] - enable/disable, show menu
* Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu

Smart mode = only show runways in range of the (un)loading point (enabled by default).

[b]Old version below if you somehow like that one better[/b]

[quote author=robin_be][color=black]
Good day all,

These are 2 CLEO mods that I made to help with landing on PL's custom islands/airports.
[b]plradar.cs[/b] shows runways on your minimap radar.
[b]plhud.cs[/b] shows the runways in 3D by drawing a line [b](contains the minimap radar mod)[/b].

[/color]
[color=red][size=18pt]plradar.cs[/size][/color]
[quote author=robin_be][color=black]
This is a CLEO mod which shows you where various runways are by placing the airstrip blip on your minimap radar. This helps in knowing the heading/angle of the runway.
[b]SA can only show one such blip per time, so only the closest runway will be shown. Smart mode makes sure the runway near the (un)loading point gets shown.[/b]

[color=red][size=18pt]plhud.cs[/size][/color]
[quote author=robin_be][color=black]
[b]This one also has the radar, you don't need plradar.cs when you use this.[/b]

This is a CLEO mod which shows you where various runways are by drawing a line on your screen.
This makes it easier to know how to do a decent approach, even with the low draw distances.

[b][size=14pt]Notes[/size][/b]
* PLHUD contains PLRADAR, you don't need them both.
* Not all runways are probably in this. Please read the point below to help me completing this.
* I used the 'nearest airport' thing to get the names. That thing doesn't work 100% so names might be wrong. See the points below.
* I used the [color=blue][u][url=http://plmap.guth3d.com/]interactive map[/url][/u][/color] to get names/airports, so thank you GeriBoss!

[b][size=14pt]Found a runway that is not in it?[/size][/b]
You can help me adding it!

* Go to one end of the runway (preferably the one that has the easiest approach), and type [font=courier]/save[/font]
* Go to the other end of the runway, and type [font=courier]/save <airportname>[/font]
* If there are multiple runways, add the heading and/or R/L (example: [font=courier]/save Angel Pine 22[/font])
* Find the file [font=courier]<your username>/documents/GTA San Andreas User Files/SAMP/savedpositions.txt[/font] and open it.
* Find the last 2 lines and post a reply with them. Example:
[/color][code]
AddPlayerClass(115,-1856.9274,-2374.4834,34.3113,315.1182,0,0,0,0,0,0); // 
AddPlayerClass(115,-1965.5531,-2483.0464,34.2633,227.0531,0,0,0,0,0,0); // Angel Pine 22
