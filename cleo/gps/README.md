# GPS

This is basically the [example GPS plugin from plugin-sdk](https://github.com/DK22Pac/plugin-sdk/tree/master/examples/GPS) ported to asm/cleo.

This version:
* doesn't show on the map
* routes to an active checkpoint or the target blip (blip takes precedence)
* shows the line even outside the radar circle
