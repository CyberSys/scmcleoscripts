ESP for snapshots, usefull for routing all snapshots speedruns  
Make sure you also put signext.cleo in your cleo folder or the game will crash (unless you've already taken all snapshots)

Usefull stuff:
* use the NotForPublicRoads (Hotring A) cheat to spawn a NRG-500
* you can't fall of your bike (unless you drive in water)
* pickups will be shown if you don't look trough the camera (and when you're within 100 units)
* Usefull data at the bottom left of the screen: viewdistance/max snapshotdistance/#snapshots taken/total # of snapshots
  
ESP is red when snapshot is too far, green when it is possible to get them.  
The calculation behind that is.. not a calculation and not very accurate, but it comes close.  
  
It doesn't check if you zoomed in far enough to get the shot, I'll add that later when I find out how to do that.
